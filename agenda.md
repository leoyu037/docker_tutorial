# Docker Lunch and Learn
- Intro
  - What is it good for
  - Why do we use it
  - Disadvantages
    - Caveat/blessing, depending on how you look at it, is that you have to
      do your own environment configuration

- Pull image
  - docker pull [namespace/image_name:tag]
- Write Dockerfile
- Build image
  - `docker build -t [namespace/image_name:tag] [base_dir]`
- Inspect images
  - `docker images`
- Run image
  - `docker run [image]`
- Run image in background
  - `docker run -d [image]
- Inspecting running containers
  - `docker ps`
- Push image
  - `docker login`
  - `docker push`
- Debugging containers
  - `docker logs`
  - `docker attach` - seeing output
  - `docker exec`
    - Getting bash shell in container
    - Running additional process in container
- Communicating from host to container
  - Expose ports
  - Inspect IP
    - `docker inspect`
- Communicating between containers
  - Linking containers
  - Docker networks
    - `docker network inspect`
- docker-compose
- OPTIONAL: Communicating from host to docker-compose network
- OPTIONAL: Communicating from another container to docker-compose network
  - `docker run --network etc.`

- Best practices?
  - using alpine instead of ubuntu
  - jenkins docker plugin
